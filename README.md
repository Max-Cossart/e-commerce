## Requirements and Purpose

### MVP

- Build a fake e-commerce store for something that interested me
- Using a FireStore backend
- Minimum 2 pages, main page with a carousel and a item page with some information about the item you have clicked on

#### Bonus

- Add a cart and be able to check out those items deducting quantity

### Tech Stack

- React
- SCSS
- JavaScript
- FireStore

## Design Goal

- My design goal for this project was to keep the it simple
  - I felt this would help draw more attention to the products rather than the website around

## Features

- A navbar to give access to the different routes
- A reusable carousel used on the landing page for a few products and on the products page to show different pictures of the product
- The Men's and Women's Pages show the full list of products
- User can add items to the cart, this is stored in session storage

## Future Goals

- Add the checkout functionality to the cart, deducting quantity from store.
- Add a total cost to cart
- Add a delete button to the cart so items can be removed
- I noticed an issue with some of the images passed to the carousel being smaller. This is causing it to change sizes on the page
